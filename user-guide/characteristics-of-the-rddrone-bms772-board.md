# Characteristics of the RDDRONE-BMS772 board

These boards have been designed and optimized for the operating conditions described below. Usage of these boards beyond these conditions can lead to malfunction and damage.

| Description                                               | Min | Max | Unit |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| Battery input voltage                                     | 6   | 26  | V    |
| Battery charge/discharge current at 25 °C (DC) **\[1]**   | -   | 90  | A    |
| Battery charge/discharge current at 25 °C (peak) **\[1]** | -   | 200 | A    |
| Operating ambient temperature                             | -20 | 60  | °C   |

_**\[1]** These values are valid for a 4 pairs of power MOSFETs and 4 heatsinks configuration. See_ [_Configuring the hardware_](getting-started-with-the-rddrone-bms772/configuring-the-hardware/#power-mosfets-and-heatsinks) _for more information_
