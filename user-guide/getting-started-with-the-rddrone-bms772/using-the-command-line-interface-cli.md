# Using the command line interface (CLI)

To use the command line interface, connect the debugger to the BMS using the 7-pin JST-GH connector from the debug adapter board to J19 and plug the USB coming from the debugger converter board into your computer.  Open a UART terminal like minicom on a Linux machine or PuTTY or Tera Term for a windows machine.

Type “bms help” to get the help for the CLI. The CLI works only with lowercase commands.                              The settings are:

* 115200 Baud
* 8 data bits
* 1 stop bit
