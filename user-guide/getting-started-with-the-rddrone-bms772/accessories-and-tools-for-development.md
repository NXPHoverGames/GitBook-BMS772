## Software example

The software example being developed for the RDDRONE-BMS772 board will use a NuttX Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).

_**Note**: NuttX is a real-time operating system (RTOS) with an emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint. Scalable from 8-bit to 32-bit microcontroller environments, the primary governing standards in NuttX are Posix and ANSI standards._
