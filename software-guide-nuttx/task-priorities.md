# Task priorities

The tasks of the BMS have different priorities, this is needed because some tasks/activities are more important than others. For example, one needs to react fast on a fault, so the system needs to prioritize a fault above blinking the LED. The BMS uses the NuttX preemption, which means that lower priority tasks get interrupted by a higher priority task. The task priorities can be seen in Figure 4.

When one of the BCC functions is called \(via the spiwrapper\), the task is locked so it canâ€™t switch tasks. This way it makes sure it will execute the function OK, otherwise there could be CRC errors or NULL responses.
