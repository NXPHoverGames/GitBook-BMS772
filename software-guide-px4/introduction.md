# Introduction

PX4.io is a flight stack or vehicle management software for mobile robotic vehicles such as drones and rovers which operates with NuttX as an underlying operating system. There will be a build target for the RDDDRONE-BMS772 that is a minimal PX4 functionality target board. 

  
The same NuttX BMS software will be ported to this minimal functionality PX4 target with the intent that some users may perfer to operate in the PX4 ecosystem since it is well maintained. Over time the software developer may wish to take advantage of PX4 functions relating to MAVLINK, uORB messaging services, authentication or other.

{% hint style="warning" %}
PX4 target is a work in progress. Please check back here for updates.   
We are expecting to have this available September/2020
