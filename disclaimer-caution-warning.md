Lithium and other batteries are dangerous and must be treated with care.&#x20;

Rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries are potentially hazardous and can present a serious FIRE HAZARD if damaged, defective or improperly used. Larger Lithium batteries and those used for industrial use involving high discharge current and frequent full discharge cycles require special precautions.\
\
Do not connect this BMS to a lithium ion battery without expertise and  training in handling and use of batteries of this type.

Use appropriate test equipment and safety protocols during development.&#x20;

## Important Notice&#x20;

NXP provides the enclosed product(s) under the following conditions:&#x20;

This reference design is intended for use of ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT OR EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY. It is provided as a sample IC pre-soldered to a printed circuit board to make it easier to access inputs, outputs, and supply terminals. This reference design may be used with any development system or other source of I/O signals by simply connecting it to the host MCU or computer board via off-the-shelf cables. Final device in an application will be heavily dependent on proper printed circuit board layout and heat sinking design as well as attention to supply filtering, transient suppression, and I/O signal quality.&#x20;

The goods provided may not be complete in terms of required design, marketing, and or manufacturing related protective considerations, including product safety measures typically found in the end product incorporating the goods.&#x20;

Due to the open construction of the product, it is the user's responsibility to take any and all appropriate precautions with regard to electrostatic discharge. In order to minimize risks associated with the customers applications, adequate design and operating safeguards must be provided by the customer to minimize inherent or procedural hazards.
