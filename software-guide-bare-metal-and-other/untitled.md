The MC33772B Battery Cell Controller \(BCC\) comes with a SW package. This package contains embedded SDK SW driver for NXPâ€™s Battery Cell Controller products and example projects for S32K144 MCU and S32 Design Studio for Arm Version 2018.R1. It exists in a Lite and a Full version:

* The Lite version is implemented and used in the NUTT-PX4 software. It allows controlling the BCC and performing its main tasks, as: measuring Cell Terminal \(CT\) voltages, current, temperatures, analog inputs, etc.. It is available on [NXP.com](https://www.nxp.com/design/analog-expert-software-and-tools/sdk-analog-expert-drivers/embedded-sw-battery-cell-controller-software-driver-for-mc33771b-mc33772b:EMBEDDED-SW-BCC)
* The Full version complements the Lite version by adding diagnostics and safety to it. This package can be useful for users wanting to add a safety layer on their applications.
